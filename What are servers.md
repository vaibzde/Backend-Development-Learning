 **A server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".**
 
 **Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client.**
 
 A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. This architecture is called the client–server model. Client–server systems are usually most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgment.

 Designating a computer as "server-class hardware" implies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard personal computers, but alternatively, large computing clusters may be composed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.
