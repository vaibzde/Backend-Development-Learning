npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js.

The package.json file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project

In package.json
- There are only two required fields; "name" and "version", 
- A version is one of the required fields of your package.json file. This field describes the current version of your project. Here's an example: "version": "1.2.0",
- but it’s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.
- like you can add the "author" : "Vaibhav",
- Another part of a good package.json file is the description     field. where a short, but informative description about your project belongs.
- The keywords field is where you can describe your project using related keywords. like "keywords": [ "descriptive", "related", "words" ],
- The license field is where you inform users of what they are allowed to do with your project. Some common licenses for open source projects include MIT and BSD.

- One of the biggest reasons to use a package manager, is their powerful dependency management. Instead of manually having to make sure that you get all dependencies whenever you set up a project on a new computer, npm automatically installs everything for you.

- Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning
Versions of the npm packages in the dependencies section of your package.json file follow what’s called Semantic Versioning (SemVer), an industry standard for software versioning aiming to make it easier to manage dependencies. Libraries, frameworks or other tools published on npm should use SemVer in order to clearly communicate what kind of changes projects can expect if they update.
 This is how Semantic Versioning works according to the official website:
"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.
- To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependency’s version with the tilde (~) character.
- the caret (^) allows npm to install future updates as well. The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.
