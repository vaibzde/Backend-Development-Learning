# Authentication
In the context of computer systems, authentication refers to the  assurance and validation of a user's identity. Before attempting to  access data stored on a network, a user must first establish their identity and obtain authorization to access the data.
To authenticate a user's identity before they can access a network, authentication uses  
various combinations of data, passcodes, QR codes, passwords, passcards, digital signatures, fingerprint, retinal, face, and voice scans.  
A secure web gateway and the implementation of numerous, integrated security  safeguards and solutions, such as next-generation firewall and endpoint protection, are  frequently used to enable proper authentication.

# Authorization 
- Allowing users access to systems and apps is now possible thanks to authentication. But  wait, there's more! Once the system has identified who the users are, restrictions can be  implemented to limit where they can go, what they can do, and what resources they have  access to. This is referred to as permission.  
	This is where Authorization comes in..
- The process by which a server assesses whether a client has  permission to use a resource or access a file is known as  authorization.
> A website's authorization criteria are often defined in the .htaccess file.
